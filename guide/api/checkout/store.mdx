title: 'Finalize Checkout Session'
---

import ShipmentIdField from '/snippets/api/url-parameters/shipment-id.mdx';

### Overview

This endpoint can be used to finalize a checkout session and pay for a shipment.

Endpoint: `/api/v1/checkout/{shipment_id}`

Method: `POST`

<Note>
    You must first use the `GET` endpoint so that the price may be calculated for the shipment. If you attempt to finalize a shipment that does not have a price, then you will receive an error.
</Note>

<Warning>
    This endpoint will charge the shipment's price to the organization's payment method.

    Please ensure that the shipment's details are correct, and that the [addresses have been verified](/guide/api/addresses/verify) before finalising the checkout session.

    Failure to do so may result in delays, lost shipments, or extra charges.
</Warning>

### URL Parameters

<ShipmentIdField action="purchase"/>

### Response (204)

If the checkout session is successfully stored, the API will return a `204 No Content` status code.

The response will not contain any content.

### Response (402)

If the checkout session was not successfully stored because the payment provider declined the organization's card, then the API will return a `402 Payment Required` status code.

<Note>
    Receiving this response will automatically invalidate your payment method. You will need to address this via the ReturnPilot website before you can make further payment attempts.
</Note>

The response will contain the following content:

<ResponseField name="status" type="integer" required>
    The internal status code of the error.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string" required>
    A human-readable message explaining the error.
</ResponseField>

### Response (409)

If the checkout session was not successfully created because payment failed, then the API will return a `409 Conflict` status code.

<Note>
    In most cases, this is a temporary error and you can simply retry the request. It is recommended that you wait a minute or so before retrying. This increases the chance that your request will be processed successfully.
</Note>

The response will contain the following content:

<ResponseField name="status" type="integer" required>
    The internal status code of the error.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string" required>
    A human-readable message explaining the error.
</ResponseField>
