import ShipmentIdField from '/snippets/api/url-parameters/shipment-id.mdx';

### Overview

This endpoint can be used to update a shipment.

Endpoint: `/api/v1/shipments/{shipment_id}`

Method: `PATCH`

<Warning>
    It's advised you use the [Verify Address](/guide/api/addresses/verify) endpoint to ensure that the origin address and destination address are valid before updating the shipment.

    Failure to verify the addresses may result in the shipment being lost, delayed, or extra charges being applied.
</Warning>

### URL Parameters

<ShipmentIdField action="update"/>

### Request

<Note>
    When updating a shipment, you can use either of the following two approaches to specify the origin and destination addresses:

    - Using the `origin_address_id` and `destination_address_id` fields to reference existing addresses that have already been stored in ReturnPilot.
    - Providing the address details directly in the `origin_address` and `destination_address` fields.

    Please note, you can use a combination of both approaches. For example, you can provide the `origin_address_id` and `destination_address` fields, or vice versa.

    For examples of how to use these fields, see the request examples on this page.
