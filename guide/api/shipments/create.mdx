title: 'Create Shipment'
---

### Overview

This endpoint can be used to create a new shipment.

Endpoint: `/api/v1/shipments`

Method: `POST`

<Warning>
    It is critical that you [verify the origin and destination addresses](/guide/api/addresses/verify) for the shipment.

    Failure to verify the addresses may result in loss or delays to the shipment.

    You may also be **charged** should address correction be necessary by the carrier.
</Warning>

### Request

<Note>
    When creating a shipment, you can use either of the following two approaches to specify the origin and destination addresses:

    - Use the `origin_address_id` and `destination_address_id` fields to reference existing addresses that have already been stored on ReturnPilot.
    - Provide the address details directly in the `origin_address` and `destination_address` fields.

    You can also combine these approaches. For example, by using a `origin_address_id` and a `destination_address`, or vice versa.

    For examples of how to use these fields, see the request examples on this page.
