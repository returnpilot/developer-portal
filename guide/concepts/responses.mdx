### Overview

The ReturnPilot API returns responses in JSON format and uses HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.

For example, a successful request to store an order will result in a response which has a `201` status code and the following body:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "return_url": "https://app.returnpilot.co/..."
}
```
