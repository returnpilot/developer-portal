### Overview

The ReturnPilot API uses a variety of formats and conventions to ensure consistency across its endpoints. This guide provides an overview of the formats you can expect to encounter when working with the API.

### Timestamp Format

All timestamps returned by the ReturnPilot API follow the given format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
```

For example, the timestamp representing the "Monday December 9, 2024 at 4:30pm" would be formatted as:

```
2024-12-09 16:30:00
```

<Note>
    All timestamps used by the API are in the Coordinated Universal Time (**UTC**) timezone.

### Phone Numbers

ReturnPilot uses the E.164 standard for recording and displaying phone numbers. This standard requires that a number be properly formatted.

#### Rules

1. It must begin with a `+` symbol prefix.
2. It must include the country code.
3. It must exclude any leading zeros.
4. It must include the area code.
5. It must include all remaining digits.
6. It must not include internal routing e.g. office extensions.
7. It must not include any other characters e.g. spaces or hyphens.

#### Examples

The following table demonstrates how a locally-formatted number in a particular country should be written to be E.164-compliant:

| Country     | Local        | E.164         |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
