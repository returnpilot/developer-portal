### Overview

The ReturnPilot API uses a variety of formats and conventions to ensure consistency across its endpoints.

This guide provides an overview of the formats you can expect to encounter when working with the API.

### Timestamps

All timestamps returned by the API follow the given format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
```

For example, "December 9, 2000 at 4:30pm" would be formatted as:

```
2000-12-09 16:30:00
```

<Note>
    The time zone is always Coordinated Universal Time (**UTC**).
</Note>

### Phone Numbers

The E.164 standard is used for recording and displaying phone numbers. This requires that a number be formatted like so:

#### Rules

1. It must begin with a `+` symbol prefix.
2. It must include the country code.
3. It must exclude any leading zeros.
4. It must include the area code.
5. It must include all remaining digits.
6. It must not include internal routing e.g. office extensions.
7. It must not include any other characters e.g. spaces or hyphens.

#### Examples

The following table demonstrates how a locally-formatted number in a particular country should be written to be E.164-compliant:

| Country     | Local        | E.164         |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
