### Overview

The following enum values represent the address verification status that can be returned by the ReturnPilot API:

| ID | Status       | Description                                                                 |
|----|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0  | Rate Limited | ReturnPilot has hit the rate limit of the external address verification system. |
| 1  | Unverified   | Something went wrong while checking the address.                            |
| 2  | Invalid      | A matching address could not be found.                                      |
| 3  | Recommended  | The address was not found, but a similar one exists.                        |
| 4  | Accepted     | The address has been verified.                                              |

<Note>
    ReturnPilot makes use of external services to verify addresses.

    A `0 (Rate Limited)` status does not indicate that your request to ReturnPilot was rate limited, but that ReturnPilot's request to the external service was rate limited.

    Unfortunately, ReturnPilot cannot provide more information about this rate limiting. Therefore, it's recommended to use a backoff strategy and retry the request after a short delay.
