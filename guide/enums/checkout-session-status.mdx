### Overview

The following enum values represent the checkout session status that can be returned by the ReturnPilot API:

| ID | Status       | Description                                                                 |
|----|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0  | Rate Limited | ReturnPilot has hit the rate limit of the external shipment rate lookup system. |
| 1  | Failed   | ReturnPilot was unable to fetch carrier rates from the external system. Try again.                            |

<Note>
    ReturnPilot makes use of external services to determine shipment rates.

    A `0 (Rate Limited)` status does not indicate that your request to ReturnPilot was rate limited, but that ReturnPilot's request to the external service was rate limited.

    Unfortunately, ReturnPilot cannot provide more information about this rate limiting. Therefore, it's recommended to use a backoff strategy and retry the request after a short delay.
